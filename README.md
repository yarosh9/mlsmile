# Mona Lisa's smile
svg graphic, portrait of a horse named Elizabeth

I had a dream (31.10.2025). I came to Sarzhyn Yar (50.02669041948611, 36.231182328836404), to the spring, for water. It was crowded. A young, beautiful horse named Elizabeth was standing a little way off. She stood there and smiled. She didn't understand why people were collecting water in vessels. After all, water confined in a vessel is like being in prison. And the free-flowing water running in the spring is much tastier and healthier.
